  storyText: "As you place the last sphere into the hole, a wave of sediment is pushed
    out from the black door. The door begins to rise. You feel yourself being sucked
    in towards the dark abyss beneath it. You struggle against the force of water
    but it\u2019s no use. Your arm slams against the wall of a ruin with tremendous
    force. (SPACE)"
