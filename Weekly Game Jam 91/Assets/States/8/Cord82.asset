  storyText: "You come upon a ruined wall that seems to surround the entire underwater
    city. There\u2019s no way through. You could try to swim over, but the wall extends
    upward for hundreds of meters, and it would be quite an effort. You\u2019re content
    to just explore along the sea floor for now.\n"
