  storyText: You enter a smaller room lined by tridents on two walls. This appears
    to be some sort of barracks. At the far end of the room is an interesting spherical
    rock with a trident carved into it. The sphere pulses with a blue energy. Although
    you are a bit afraid of the rock, it will have significant archaeological value.
    You take the stone and carefully slip it into your diving bag.
