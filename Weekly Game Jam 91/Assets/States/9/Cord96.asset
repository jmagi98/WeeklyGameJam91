  storyText: You enter the small shrine. Ahead of you is a tiny grotto with a glowing
    sphere. The sphere has a carved image of a wave on it. It pulses slowly with a
    soft green light. Although wary of the sphere and its energy, you feel like it
    will be worth a lot of money to a museum. You grab it and put it away in your
    diving bag.
