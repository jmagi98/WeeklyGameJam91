  storyText: "You spot something metallic in the sandy ground. You dig at the ground
    with your hands, trying to see what it is. After a few seconds of clawing at the
    object, you discover a broken trident. It\u2019s sharp, but it will only weigh
    you down, so you lay it carefully back on the sea floor."
