  storyText: "Inside the room, you see a red pulsing stone. It almost looks like a
    beating heart. As you approach, you see that it\u2019s a perfect sphere engraved
    with an octopus carving. It beats quickly, and although you feel afraid, you know
    that you should take this stone with you. You reach out to it slowly, making contact
    with the beating sphere. Nothing happens as you touch it, so you pull it back
    toward you and save it in your diving bag."
