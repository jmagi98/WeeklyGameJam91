    dark, but you felt the air move and are certain that you didn\u2019t cause it.
    You turn your face but can\u2019t make anything out. You reach out for your flashlight
    on the ground, turning it to face the direction of the noise. You see one of the
    rotten, decaying tentacles darting towards you, its tip outstretched. Everything
    goes black.\r (SPACE)"
