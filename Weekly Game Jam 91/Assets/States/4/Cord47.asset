  storyText: "Scattered around on the sea floor and nearby rocks are remnants of pottery.
    You grab a few pieces and examine them. They have the same drawings and hieroglyphs
    that you\u2019ve seen elsewhere in these ruins. Looking at them gives you an uneasy
    feeling. It\u2019s likely you\u2019re the first and only person to have seen these
    since the destruction of this city."
